Py
Python Dynamically Types
• When a variable is declared it must be initialise as well
• Variables do not have a specific type , it’s type depends on the value which we provide
Ex :
X = 25		 - integer type
X = 13.75 - float type
X = ‘A'	 - string type
• For the above example we can say that, Python is a dynamically typed language
meaning while defining a variable we don’t have to give its type expictilly like in other
languages such as c++ , Java
• To know what type of data is provided to the variable we use type(x)
Ex :
• The above result is <class ‘int ’> meaning the given data type belongs to a class of
integer
• As we know every thing in python is an object and every object will have its own class
• The class is decided on the type of variable we provide 

# practice
a=10
print(a)
# 10
name='Soap'
print(name)
# soap -output
a,b,c=5,10,15
print(a,b,c)
# 5 10 15-output

name,price,weight='toothpaste',10.5,5
print(price)
# 10.5-output

x=25
type(x)
print(x)
# 25 -output
