# what is anagram
ChatGPT
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase. 
In other words, the original word or phrase can be rearranged to create a new word or phrase that uses all the same letters.
For example, the word "listen" can be rearranged to form the word "silent," making them anagrams of each other. 
Anagrams can be a fun way to explore different combinations of letters and create new words or phrases.
